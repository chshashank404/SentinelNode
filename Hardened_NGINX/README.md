# Algorand Node NGINX Hardening Module

## Project Overview

This repository provides an NGINX hardening module for enhancing the security and stability of Algorand nodes running within Docker. The module introduces a hardened configuration tailored for blockchain infrastructure, with a focus on Algorand, to safeguard against common threats, improve performance, and ensure reliable access to node services.

### Key Features
- **Rate Limiting & Connection Control**: Prevents abuse through configurable request rate limits and connection quotas.
- **Security Headers**: Adds industry-standard headers to mitigate XSS, clickjacking, and content-sniffing attacks.
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optionally restricts access to trusted IPs only.
- **Enhanced Logging Options**: Logs are suppressed by default but can be enabled for debugging purposes.

## Configuration Explanation

The following key settings are configured in the NGINX hardening module:

- **Rate Limiting (`limit_req_zone` and `limit_req`)**: Controls the rate of incoming requests to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
  - `limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=5r/s;` limits each client to 5 requests per second.
  - `limit_req zone=api_limit burst=10 nodelay;` allows occasional bursts of 10 requests with no delay.
  
- **Connection Limiting (`limit_conn_zone` and `limit_conn`)**: Restricts the maximum number of simultaneous connections per client.
  - `limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=conn_limit:10m;` tracks connections by client IP.
  - `limit_conn conn_limit 20;` limits each client to 20 concurrent connections.

- **Security Headers**:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";` prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type.
  - `X-Frame-Options "DENY";` blocks the page from being displayed in a frame, preventing clickjacking attacks.
  - `X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";` enables XSS filtering and blocks the page if an attack is detected.
  - `Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;` enforces HTTPS for 1 year.
  - `Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';";` restricts the sources of content and disables framing.

- **CORS Configuration (`map` and `add_header`)**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for private network requests.
  - `map` and `add_header` directives allow the Algorand node to communicate securely within a private network.

- **IP Whitelisting** *(Optional)*:
  - The configuration includes an optional whitelist for trusted IPs.
  - Uncomment and configure IP addresses to allow only specific clients to access the node.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running.
2. **NGINX in Docker**: This configuration assumes NGINX is running as a reverse proxy for Algorand services in a Docker container.
3. **Access to NGINX Container**: You should have permissions to modify the NGINX configuration inside the Docker container.

### Applying the Configuration
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorand-nginx-hardening.git
   cd algorand-nginx-hardening
   ```

2. **Copy Hardened NGINX Configuration**:
   - Replace the existing NGINX configuration with the hardened version.
   ```bash
   docker cp hardened_nginx.conf <nginx_container_name>:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

3. **Reload NGINX**:
   - Restart NGINX to apply the changes.
   ```bash
   docker exec <nginx_container_name> nginx -s reload
   ```

### Verifying the Setup
1. **Check NGINX Status**:
   - Ensure NGINX is running correctly by checking logs and container status:
   ```bash
   docker logs <nginx_container_name>
   ```

2. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   - Try sending rapid, repeated requests from a single IP to verify rate limiting. If configured correctly, requests should be throttled after the limit is reached.

3. **Inspect Security Headers**:
   - Use `curl` or a browserâ€™s Developer Tools to check for security headers in the response.
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:4001
   ```

4. **IP Whitelisting (If Enabled)**:
   - Attempt accessing from both a whitelisted IP and a non-whitelisted IP to verify access control.

## Testing the Configuration

To test the hardened NGINX setup, perform the following checks:

1. **Rate Limiting Test**:
   - Use a tool like `ab` (Apache Bench) or `curl` in a loop to send multiple requests and observe if NGINX starts limiting requests.
   ```bash
   ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:4001/
   ```
   - You should see HTTP 429 errors ("Too Many Requests") when the rate limit is exceeded.

2. **Security Header Test**:
   - Verify the response headers using `curl` or browser tools:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:4001
   ```
   - Confirm that `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `Content-Security-Policy` headers are present.

3. **Connection Limiting Test**:
   - Open multiple connections (more than the configured limit) and verify that additional connections are dropped.
   - Example with `curl`:
   ```bash
   for i in {1..25}; do curl http://localhost:4001 & done
   ```

### Additional Tips
- For production, monitor the logs to adjust rate limits and connection counts based on real traffic patterns.
- Regularly check for any NGINX updates or patches, as new security improvements may become available.

This NGINX hardening module enhances the reliability and security of Algorand nodes. We encourage contributions to expand or further optimize this configuration for different environments.
