# **SentinelNode: Node-Level Forensic Analysis Framework for BFT-Based Blockchains**

Welcome to **SentinelNode**, an open-source framework for monitoring, analyzing, and securing blockchain nodes in BFT-based protocols like Algorand. SentinelNode helps developers, security researchers, and enterprises detect malicious node behavior, analyze consensus mechanisms, and preserve forensic data for audit and compliance.

## **Core Focus Areas**
- **Node Security & Monitoring**
- **Forensic Analysis & Investigation**
- **Consensus Integrity & Trust**

## **Project Overview**
SentinelNode is designed to secure and investigate node behavior in distributed, Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain networks such as **Algorand**. The framework is modular, providing specific tools for malicious node detection, real-time monitoring, forensic auditing, and consensus manipulation detection.

This project is developed for the **AlgoBharat Impact Summit 2024 - DevTrack** and aims to foster collaboration and innovation in the blockchain security space.

## **Sub-Projects**
### **NodeGuard**: Security & Monitoring
NodeGuard is responsible for real-time node monitoring and health analysis. It detects malicious behavior and ensures the stability and security of blockchain nodes by providing:
- **Malicious Node Detection**
- **Network Anomaly Detection**
- **Node Health Scoring**
- **Real-Time Alerts**

---

### **ForensiNode**: Forensic Analysis & Investigation
ForensiNode enables forensic investigations, preserving logs and providing an audit trail for post-incident analysis and regulatory compliance. Key features include:
- **Forensic Data Preservation**
- **Incident Response**
- **Post-Incident Analysis**
- **Regulatory Reporting**

---

### **ConsensusGuard**: Consensus Protection & Trust
ConsensusGuard protects the integrity of the blockchain consensus process. It helps detect voting fraud, collusion, and attempts to manipulate consensus mechanisms:
- **Consensus Manipulation Detection**
- **Governance Integrity**
- **Collusion Detection**

---

## **Why Open Source?**
Blockchain security thrives on transparency and decentralized contributions. By making SentinelNode open-source, we invite developers, researchers, and enterprises to:
- Contribute to enhancing the toolâ€™s capabilities.
- Collaborate across different BFT blockchain platforms.
- Ensure better security for blockchain networks through rigorous testing and adoption.

---

## **Features**
### **SentinelNode Features at a Glance**:
- **Modular Design**: Each sub-project can be used independently or integrated into the larger framework.
- **Node Behavior Analysis**: Identify malicious or abnormal node behaviors within BFT blockchain networks.
- **Consensus Integrity**: Ensure the security of voting mechanisms, especially in decentralized systems like DeFi.
- **Forensic Logging**: Immutable, cryptographically secure logging of node behaviors for investigation.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Get immediate notifications when suspicious activities are detected.
